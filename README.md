## Built With 
- JavaScript
- React
- Webpack
- HTML/SCSS
- Node.JS
- Jest
- Cypress


## Getting Started

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it from there

- [React Template](https://github.com/Mhdez221993/react-template)

### Setup

```cmd
git clone  git@github.com:Mhdez221993/JavaScript-capstone-project.git
cd JavaScript-capstone-project
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

### `npm run e2s`
To run end to end test with cypress

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.


### `npm run build` fails to minify
